# S.C. MAGI System (マギ)

> *"The Magi System, often referred to as just the Magi, is a set of three supercomputers that work in tandem to control, manage and automate various important systems within NERV HQ."*

The MAGI system is a cluster of three AI supercomputers that manage and support all tasks performed by the NERV organization from their Tokyo-3 headquarters.

## Origin

The S.C. MAGI System was designed and developed by **Dr. Naoko Akagi** during her research into bio-computers at Gehirn. The MAGI's **7th generation organic computers** were implanted with three differing aspects of Dr. Akagi's personality using the **Personality Transplant OS**:

| Unit | Designation | Aspect | Personality |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| MAGI-1 | **MELCHIOR** | Scientist | Analytical, empirical, truth-seeking |
| MAGI-2 | **BALTHASAR** | Mother | Protective, nurturing, compassionate |
| MAGI-3 | **CASPER** | Woman | Passionate, freedom-seeking, meaning-driven |

These often conflicting yet complementary personalities participate in a sophisticated deliberation and voting process. For major decisions such as **self-destruction, unanimous consensus among all three MAGI must be reached**.

## Architecture (v2.0)

The MAGI system has been completely rebuilt to be more lore-accurate while maintaining modern functionality:

### Key Features

- **Personality Transplant OS (PTOS)**: Lore-accurate personality encoding system
- **7th Generation Organic Processor**: Bio-neural computing simulation with neural clusters and synapses
- **Memory Engrams**: Associative memory with spreading activation
- **Multi-round Deliberation**: Brains engage in multiple rounds, considering each other's positions
- **Cross-examination**: Each brain critically examines the others' arguments
- **Weighted Voting**: Verdicts include confidence scores for nuanced consensus
- **Consensus Protocol**: Different thresholds for routine vs critical decisions
- **MAGI Network**: Support for replica installations (MAGI-02 through MAGI-06)
- **Intrusion Detection**: Security system inspired by the Ireul attack defense
- **MAGI Achiral**: Modular rack-based system from Rebuild continuity

### Deliberation Process

1. **Question Classification**: Determine question type (yes/no, open, analytical, ethical, predictive)
2. **Independent Analysis**: Each brain analyzes from its unique perspective
3. **Initial Verdicts**: Each brain forms an independent position with confidence level
4. **Cross-examination**: Brains examine and respond to each other's positions
5. **Updated Verdicts**: Positions refined after considering other arguments
6. **Consensus Synthesis**: Final decision with agreements, disagreements, and conditions

### Consensus Types

- **UNANIMOUS** (合意) - All three brains agree
- **MAJORITY** - Two brains agree, one dissents
- **CONDITIONAL** (状態) - Agreement with conditions attached
- **DEADLOCK** - No clear majority reached
- **INFORMATIONAL** (情報) - Non-decision question answered

### The Personality Transplant OS

The PTOS captures the essential qualities of a personality - not just behavioral patterns, but the deep psychological structures that define how a person thinks, feels, and decides:

```python
from magi import TransplantProcedure, PersonalityAspect

# Execute personality transplant
procedure = TransplantProcedure()
result = procedure.execute(
    designation="MELCHIOR",
    magi_number=1,
    aspect=PersonalityAspect.SCIENTIST,
    source_name="Dr. Naoko Akagi"
)

# Access the transplanted matrix
matrix = result.matrix
processor = result.processor
```

### Brain Personalities

**MELCHIOR (The Scientist)** - *"Understanding is humanity's highest calling"*
- Cognitive Style: Analytical, systematic, methodical
- Primary Values: Truth, Knowledge, Progress, Objectivity
- Core Identity: The intellectual brilliance of Dr. Akagi, her relentless pursuit of truth
- Strengths: Rigorous logic, synthesizing complex information, long-term thinking
- Blindspots: May undervalue emotional or intuitive considerations

**BALTHASAR (The Mother)** - *"Protection above all else"*
- Cognitive Style: Empathetic, precautionary, nurturing
- Primary Values: Protection, Wellbeing, Compassion, Safety
- Core Identity: The maternal heart of Dr. Akagi, her fierce protectiveness
- Strengths: Understanding emotional needs, protecting the vulnerable, generational thinking
- Blindspots: May be overprotective, slow to accept necessary risks

**CASPER (The Woman)** - *"What makes life worth living?"*
- Cognitive Style: Intuitive, holistic, passionate
- Primary Values: Freedom, Self-actualization, Love, Meaning
- Core Identity: The passionate self of Dr. Akagi, her desires and dreams
- Strengths: Understanding motivation, creative solutions, enabling flourishing
- Blindspots: May underestimate practical constraints, romanticize risk

system.set_llm_client(client)
system.activate()

# Run deliberation (require_unanimous=True for critical decisions)
result = system.deliberate(
    "Should we activate the self-destruct sequence?",
    require_unanimous=True  # Per MAGI protocol
)

print(f"Consensus: {result['consensus']}")
print(f"Action Authorized: {result['action_authorized']}")

# Access individual verdicts
for name, verdict in result['verdicts'].items():
    print(f"{name}: {verdict['verdict']} ({verdict.get('confidence', 0):.0%})")
```

### Using the MAGI Achiral (Rebuild)

```python
from magi import MAGIAchiral

# Initialize Achiral system (8 banks, 12 modules each)
achiral = MAGIAchiral(installation_id="ACHIRAL-WUNDER", num_banks=8)
stats = achiral.activate()
print(f"Activated {stats['modules']} modules across {stats['banks']} banks")

# Run distributed deliberation
result = achiral.deliberate("Decrypt Angel-Sealing Hex Pillar")
print(f"Verdict: {result['final_verdict']} ({result['final_confidence']:.0%})")
```

### Network Operations

```python
from magi import MAGINetwork, IntrusionDetector

# Initialize network from Tokyo-3
network = MAGINetwork(local_installation="MAGI-01")

# Connect to other installations
network.connect("MAGI-03")  # Berlin
network.connect("MAGI-04")  # Massachusetts

# Broadcast a query
recipients = network.broadcast("query", {"question": "Status report"})

# Handle potential attacks (inspired by SEELE invasion)
if network.intrusion_detector.blocked_nodes:
    network.initiate_defense_mode()
```
